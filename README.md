**pCDK2i** stands for **p**redictor of **CDK2** **i**nhibitor. 

It is an online tool hosted on Google Colab [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1w--caiI-QA31KkU774JaJGgwj9S9g3GO?usp=sharing) that predict the CDK2 inhibitory property (1 = Active, 0 = Inactive) of a small molecule and also visualize the molecule.

This Google Colab notebook is a supplementary material of the paper "*Integrating Machine Learning with In Silico Studies: Exploring Novel Compounds through Multiscale Screening Targeting the CDK2 Enzyme*" (Manuscript under preparation).
